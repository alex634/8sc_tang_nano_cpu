# 8sc

## Introduction

This is an 8 bit single cycle CPU. It is inspired by the 32 bit RISC single cycle processor architecture that is used to teach hardware architecture. To reduce complexity in implementation, the least amount of instructions deemed feasible was implemented. This CPU has 8 different instructions, 256 bytes of instruction ROM and 256 bytes of read write memory.
